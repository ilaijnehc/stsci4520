## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
dat <- read.csv("/Users/jialichen/Downloads/statcomp2023/datasets/hurdat2-1851-2021-041922.txt", header= FALSE)

nd <- dat %>%
  mutate(date = case_when( substr(V1, 1, 2) == "AL" ~ V1), .before = 1) %>%
  fill(date) %>%
  filter(!is.na(V7))

names <- dat[grepl('AL', dat$V1), ]

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
